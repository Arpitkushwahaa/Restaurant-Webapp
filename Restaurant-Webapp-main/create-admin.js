  Create Admin User for Food App
====================================

This script creates an admin user with the following credentials:
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123

To create this admin user, simply log in with these credentials.
The system will automatically recognize this email and grant admin privileges.

For better security in production:
1. Change this default password immediately after first login
2. Implement proper admin management through the application

====================================
